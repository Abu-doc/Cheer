                Hola Ana, mi Insomnia Queen!!â™•
                <br>
                I just met you last month, and never in my life did I think Iâ€™d be sitting here, making this for you. But thatâ€™s life, huh? Unpredictable. Wild. Just like you. 
                <br>
                Iâ€™ve met many girls before, but you? Youâ€™re the first one I truly connected with. And the irony? It all started just by talking online. No fancy real-life meetups, no extravagant momentsâ€”just words, and somehow, they meant everything. 
                <br>
                Youâ€™re one of a kind, and thatâ€™s their loss if they donâ€™t see it.  
                <br>
                Baby girl, everything is gonna be okay. Donâ€™t stress too much. Youâ€™re not alone, and you never will be.  
                <br>
                I hope one day, I get to meet you in real life. I hope I get to see that beautiful smile** in person. Until then...  
                <br>
                Loves and kisses. ðŸ’‹
